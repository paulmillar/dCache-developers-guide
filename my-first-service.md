# My first service

A whistle-stop tour tour of different dCache sub-systems.  In several steps, we will add a simple service and then expand what the service can do.  This provides us with the opportunity to give a brief introduction to various dCache subsystems.

## A service to say Hello World

In this section we add the bare minimum to have a service we can start.

## Being flexible: dCache configuration

Here, we start making our service more flexible by allowing administrators to modify how it behaves.

## Introducing spring: bringing Java into the game

So far, we haven't used any Java code.  This changes now, as we start creating some simple code that dCache will run as part of a cell.

## The admin interface: on-line inspection and configuration

The admin interface is a powerful mechanism within dCache for adjusting a live system.

## Logging: for admins and developers

Here we have a look at adding some basic logging and see how to get the most from it.

## Bringing users into the fore: adding network ports

So far, the service hasn't had any users.  This changes as we add the possibility of users interacting with our service.

## dCache communication 101

dCache is a heterogeneous service with different cells sending messages to synchronise behaviour.  In this section we look some of the possibilities.

## Logging in with gPlazma

Following on from the previous section, here we add the ability to authenticate our users and discover information about them.

## Handling the namespace

In this section adds some basic interaction with the namespace.

## Handling content: pools and movers

A brief introduction on how content is handled and how different protocols are supported.
